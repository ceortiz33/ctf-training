# Overpass2

# Story

Overpass has been hacked! The SOC team (Paradox, congratulations on the promotion) noticed suspicious activity on a late night shift while looking at shibes, and managed to capture packets as the attack happened.

Can you work out how the attacker got in, and hack your way back into Overpass' production server?

In this CTF we start with a pcap file of the logs of a previous attack to the site.
